#### Grade
- 2% of final grade (if one of five completed exercises, see further guidelines at bottom)

- Section B (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 21 September 2021

## Objectives

1. Continue to get comfortable using Git and GitHub when you work on new projects
2. Declaring and changing variables (especially JavaScript objects!)
3. Using `map()` and `constrain()`

## Set up

1. Create an `exercises` folder in your `cc1` repository.
2. Download the `template-p5-project` and rename the folder to `i-like-to-move-it`
3. Move the `i-like-to-move-it` folder to your `exercises` folder
4. Open the `i-like-to-move-it` folder in Atom
5. Commit and push in GitHub Desktop with a message saying "E1: Started exercise 1"

## Brief

Create a program full of shapes that move, change size and color, and anything else you want to experiment with. Feel free to begin with the code you built in activity 3.

Your program should at a **minimum**

1. Include three shapes
2. Include movement
3. Include size changes
4. Include color changes
5. Use `map()` and `constrain()`
6. Respond to the mouse position using `mouseX` and `mouseY`

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cc1/tree/master/exercises/i-like-to-move-it/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cc1/exercises/i-like-to-move-it/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Has **suitable commenting**
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `Ex:`**.
- Uses **good naming** for added variables
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
